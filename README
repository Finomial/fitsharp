Docker Build & Execute (.NET Core 2) for Windows
------------------------------------------------

On Windows goto Docker->Settings->Shared Drives and enable sharing of drive C:\ with your containers.

If you get a firewall message, follow the documentation link. To test shared drives, execute the alpine example
in the Shared Drives dialog box. Until this is working you won't be able to see the test output

If running cmd.exe or PowerShell:

md c:\output
md c:\output\FitSharp

docker build . -t fitsharp

docker run --rm -v c:/output:/site fitsharp

open c:\output in File Explorer and launch a browser on reportIndex.html

If running git-bash:

mkdir -p /c/output/FitSharp

docker build . -t fitsharp

docker run --rm -v c://output://site fitsharp
